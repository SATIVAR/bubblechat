# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Document Processing module is a core component of the Bubblle Agent CRM platform that enables the extraction, processing, and analysis of text from various document formats (images, PDFs, spreadsheets). This processed text is then used by the LLM to generate accurate budgets and responses based on client requirements. The module aims to optimize token usage by preprocessing documents locally before sending only relevant text to LLM providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload and Type Detection

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want to upload various document types (images, PDFs, Excel/CSV) containing client requirements, so that I can automatically extract relevant information for budget generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate the file type (image, PDF, Excel, CSV) and size
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it temporarily in a secure location
3. WHEN a file is received THEN the system SHALL detect its MIME type and extension
4. WHEN a file type is detected THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate processor
5. IF the file type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
6. WHEN multiple files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process each file individually and combine the results

### Requirement 2: Image Processing with OCR

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the system to extract text from images (screenshots, photos of documents), so that I don't have to manually transcribe content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image file is detected THEN the system SHALL use Tesseract.js to perform OCR
2. WHEN performing OCR THEN the system SHALL support Portuguese language by default
3. WHEN OCR is complete THEN the system SHALL return the extracted text
4. IF OCR fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message
5. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL handle various image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP)
6. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL optimize the image if needed for better OCR results

### Requirement 3: PDF Document Processing

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want to extract text from PDF documents containing client specifications, so that I can quickly generate budgets without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is detected THEN the system SHALL use pdf-parse to extract text content
2. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL maintain text formatting where possible
3. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL handle multi-page documents
4. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract text from both searchable and scanned PDFs (using OCR for the latter)
5. IF PDF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed error message

### Requirement 4: Spreadsheet Processing

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want to extract structured data from Excel and CSV files, so that I can use client-provided specifications in tabular format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spreadsheet file is detected THEN the system SHALL use xlsx library to extract data
2. WHEN processing spreadsheets THEN the system SHALL convert tabular data to a structured text format
3. WHEN processing spreadsheets THEN the system SHALL handle multiple sheets in Excel files
4. WHEN processing spreadsheets THEN the system SHALL preserve column headers and relationships between data
5. IF spreadsheet processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message

### Requirement 5: Text Preprocessing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want uploaded documents to be preprocessed before sending to LLMs, so that we can optimize token usage and improve response quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is extracted from any document THEN the system SHALL clean and normalize the text
2. WHEN preprocessing text THEN the system SHALL remove irrelevant characters and normalize spaces
3. WHEN preprocessing text THEN the system SHALL perform tokenization to break text into meaningful units
4. WHEN preprocessing text THEN the system SHALL optionally remove stopwords to reduce noise
5. WHEN preprocessing text THEN the system SHALL format the output in a consistent structure
6. WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the cleaned text ready for LLM processing

### Requirement 6: Integration with LLM Services

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the processed document text to be sent to LLMs for budget generation, so that I can quickly create accurate client proposals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL send the processed text to the configured LLM provider
2. WHEN sending text to LLMs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate prompts for budget generation
3. WHEN communicating with LLMs THEN the system SHALL handle API errors gracefully
4. WHEN receiving LLM responses THEN the system SHALL format the budget according to predefined templates
5. WHEN generating budgets THEN the system SHALL store both the processed input and generated output for future reference

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the document processing module to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, so that users don't experience delays during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL handle operations asynchronously
2. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL process multiple documents concurrently
3. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL implement timeouts and resource limits
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL be containerized for easy scaling
5. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics for monitoring
